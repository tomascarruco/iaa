    Could Love for ever
    Run like a river,
    And Time's endeavour
      Be tried in vain--
    No other pleasure
    With this could measure;
    And like a treasure
      We'd hug the chain.
    But since our sighing
    Ends not in dying,
    And, formed for flying,
      Love plumes his wing;
    Then for this reason
    Let's love a season;
But let that season be only Spring.

    When lovers parted
    Feel broken-hearted,
    And, all hopes thwarted,
      Expect to die;
    A few years older,
    Ah! how much colder
    They might behold her
      For whom they sigh!
    When linked together,
    In every weather,
    They pluck Love's feather
      From out his wing--
    He'll stay for ever,
    But sadly shiver
Without his plumage, when past the Spring.

    Like Chiefs of Faction,
    His life is action--
    A formal paction
      That curbs his reign,
    Obscures his glory,
    Despot no more, he
    Such territory
      Quits with disdain.
    Still, still advancing,
    With banners glancing,
    His power enhancing,
      He must move on--
    Repose but cloys him,
    Retreat destroys him,
Love brooks not a degraded throne.

    Wait not, fond lover!
    Till years are over,
    And then recover
      As from a dream.
    While each bewailing
    The other's failing.
    With wrath and railing,
      All hideous seem--
    While first decreasing,
    Yet not quite ceasing,
    Wait not till teasing,
      All passion blight:
    If once diminished
    Love's reign is finished--
Then part in friendship,--and bid good-night.

    So shall Affection
    To recollection
    The dear connection
      Bring back with joy:
    You had not waited
    Till, tired or hated,
    Your passions sated
      Began to cloy.
    Your last embraces
    Leave no cold traces--
    The same fond faces
      As through the past:
    And eyes, the mirrors
    Of your sweet errors,
Reflect but rapture--not least though last.

    True, separations
    Ask more than patience;
    What desperations
      From such have risen!
    But yet remaining,
    What is't but chaining
    Hearts which, once waning,
      Beat 'gainst their prison?
    Time can but cloy love,
    And use destroy love:
    The wing√©d boy, Love,
      Is but for boys--
    You'll find it torture
    Though sharper, shorter,
To wean, and not wear out your joys.
